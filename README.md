# Breast-Tumour-Detection-using-DeepLearning
The proposed project utilizes a deep learning-based approach for breast tumour detection using a U-Net architecture integrated with a ResNet34 backbone. This model enables precise segmentation of tumour regions in breast ultrasound images, facilitating accurate and early diagnosis.
